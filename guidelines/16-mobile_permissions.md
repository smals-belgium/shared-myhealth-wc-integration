# Guidelines on smartphone permissions

In the table below you can find all possible permission. We've marked the ones we already requested. 
If you need additional permissions, please contact the MAGS support team ([mags@smals.be]) and explain why you need them.

If you are requesting a sensitive permission (e.g., access to location, camera, contacts, or microphone), we need a 
clear and detailed explanation of why this access is required.

Please note:

- The feature must be core to your webcomponent's functionality â€” not just a convenience.
- You should describe how the permission will be used and what will break or not work without it.

Please provide:

- A description of the feature that needs the permission
- Why the webcomponent cannot function without it
- Any user-facing justification (e.g., pop-up or UI explanation) you will include

Without a strong use case, this permission may be denied or lead to app store rejection.
