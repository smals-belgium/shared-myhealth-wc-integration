# Guideline on mobile gestures supported in Mags-app

## Swiping Gestures

- **Side-to-Side Swipe**: Navigate between tabs and views by swiping horizontally. This provides a smooth, intuitive 
way to switch between different sections of the app.
- **Downward Pull (Refresh)**: Pull down from the top of any content page to refresh. This functionality comes built 
into the Mags shell.

## Touch Actions

- **Tab Selection**: Simply tap on any item to select or activate it. 

## Gesture Limitations

The platform does not support additional gesture types by default. Gestures such as pinching, long-pressing, or 
vertical swiping (except for refresh) are not implemented in Mags.

If a new gesture is necessary, you must formally request its inclusion. The request will be reviewed for alignment 
with platform guidelines and usability standards.

Only upon approval will the gesture be supported and permitted for implementation.

Notably, horizontal swiping is reserved exclusively for navigation between tabs/views and should not be used for other
interactions like deleting items from a list (as commonly seen in apps like Gmail).
