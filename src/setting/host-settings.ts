 * The properties that all myhealth web components will receive from their host application.

 *  - configName
 * see their respective docs for more details.
 * Dealing with `crashReportingEnabled` is only necessary if the web component uses a crash report tool such as Sentry.
 *
 * All these properties can change at runtime and the web component has to be able to deal with those changes.
 * Monitoring those changes can be done by watching changes in these properties,
 * or by listening for `SettingsChange` events on the event bus provided as a service.
 * (The decision on this choice will most likely depend on the number of components in a module, or the framework used)
